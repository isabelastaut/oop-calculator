# Sphere Calculator with OOP

This project was created while studying object-oriented programming in C#.
It's a sphere calculator that asks for the radius of a sphere and then calculates its **circumference**, **volume** and **surface area**. The same program was written in 3 different ways: 
- **Program dependent**: All methods are inside the Program class.
- **Instance members**: All methods are instance methods inside the Calculator class.
- **Static members**: All methods are static methods inside the Calculator class.
